Bings Ads Reporting 

This point of this project was to call the microsoft ads api and download the report programmatically given Microsofts lack of functionality 
in terms of delviering the reports.

At the moment this downloads the file into a CSV but could easily be adjusted to load the data into a data frame if needed.

Open to any suggestions on how to improve - it's by no means a finished or polished solution!
